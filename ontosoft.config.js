	<p>OntoSoft is a platform to provide a community repository for \
	    geosciences software. Key features of OntoSoft are:</p> \
	<ol> \
	    <li><b>Allowing contributors to specify structured metadata</b> \
	        about software, including input requirements, physical variables and \
	        assumptions, and software runtime dependencies. OntoSoft uses this \
	        structured metadata to improve search, to facilitate software reuse, \
	        and to support software integration. \
	        <a href=\'#list\'><b>START HERE</b></a> to publish your own software in OntoSoft. \
	        Please register for an account in order to publish</center></li> \
	    <li><b>Assisting geoscientists to make their software more \
	            reusable.</b> OntoSoft includes mini-tutorials to introduce geoscientists \
	        to topics such as licenses, software libraries, and software reuse.</li> \
	    <li><b>Maintaining compatibility with existing software \
	            catalogues</b> , such as software repositories (e.g., GitHub) and model \
	        frameworks (e.g., CSDMS, CIG). OntoSoft includes links to software \
	        repositories, and import/export capabilities for model frameworks.</li> \
	</ol> \
	<p> \
	    OntoSoft is still under development. Please <a \
